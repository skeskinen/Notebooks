Peter's arrogance is one of his most charming qualities.

Peter overheard his parents talking about what he should become, rejected it and ran away.

The female characters always see that Peter needs a mother.

Children are gay, innocent and heartless. They forget how to fly after they lose these qualities.
Heartless: When you are carefree you are insensitive to needs of the others. Children don't know heartbreak so they don't understand the consequences of their actions. They don't understand loss so they can't be hurt in the same way.


Peterson:

Children have potential. At some point you have to swap the potential for something concrete, a frame that you can use to orient your life.
The flip happens eventually wether you like it or not. It's better if you choose your own sacrifice.
You shouldn't prolong the process since 30-40 year old man-child is not a pleasant sight.

Our current culture is lacks a process or place that matures people. Universities are the worst offenders since you can choose nothing and stay there until you are 25+.
The world is changing faster now which means that it is harder for people to find themselves.

Growing up: becoming independent from your parents. Extending your society beyond your family.

For any social animal, the individuals have to develop to a point where they can take care of themselves without disrupting the society. If this were not the case then the species would be self-destructive. Society precedes existance.
Since human societies have a large culture component, the ways you need to act in order to not disrupt the society are quite complex. The correct ways to behave have to be taught both implicitly and explicitly. 

Initiation rites might be necessary or maybe they aren't. The process of growing up is different for everyone. But some sort of shock makes it more likely to happen and happen fast. Prolonging the process might have unwanted consequences.

When you change your old personality is destroyed and a new one emerges.
