Problems in current culture are caused by misunderstanding post-modernism. They are not direct consequences of post-modern thought but the death of teleology.

Teleology = end/aim + reason, it is the belief that things can have meaning or purpose.

Classical view implies that the past had a direction. Everything upto now was part of cultural evolution that worked towards betterment of human society.

The author tried to reject structure but had to accept in the end that their life got better after settling down.

Postmodernism should be seen as an acceptance that interpreting changes meaning and meaning is negotiable. There is constant dialogue about the nodes and edges in the map of meaning and each human is also part of that graph as a node.



I'm not sure I understand anything in the second half of the article. 

There is some sort of refuting of modern postmodernism, discussion about critical theory and description of modern culture.
Young people are robbed of meanings and they become defensive and aggressive. They are told that they have to construct their own meaning which makes them toxicly individualistic and obnoxious.

Existentialism makes people annoying. They refuse the common and there are less contact points.

Loss of meaning creates very real suffering.

Conclusion seems to be that we need to change education so that it doesn't destroy people. We need to teach them in a way that they can handle the social life. So that people don't feel like all hierarchies are violence.


The whole thing seems absurd. Why did people create this thought that hierarchies are violence in the first place? And why do we need to educate them to not develop this mindset.
Asian philosophies can develop similar sounding ideas without all the suffering and loss of social fabric. The key seems to be that asian philosophies do not start with the individual.

Existentialism seems toxic. If your starting point that you need to find meaning inside your head, it's shouldn't surprise anyone that teens cannot handle that. And that they'll develop weird notions of how the world works. 
Starting your philosophy from the notion of individual seems like an awful idea.

Article ends with saying that we need to cherish the remaining social fabric and start building new one.
