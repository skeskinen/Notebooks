There will not be unified climate change action since nobody knows what to do. There are too many ideas, all of them unproven and some of them failed already. It is all too vague.
Everyone has their favourite approach. The opinions are too strong and decisions too political. These conditions make unified action near impossible.

The type of people who actually get things done will focus on the solvable problems instead.

Almost all global development goals with good return on invesment revolve around childcare. If we could make 10 million more geniuses that would have real value.
This sounds reasonable, but can we turn genius into wisdom?
