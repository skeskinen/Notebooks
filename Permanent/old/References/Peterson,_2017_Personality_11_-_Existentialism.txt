Existentialism comes from the angst of man. It tries to make the vast universe understandable for the individual. It has risen in relevance after the traditional belief systems fell apart, but existential angst always existed to some degree.

"Thrownness" describes the condition of absurdity of existance. Why do you exist now and not then? Why are you here and not there? The time and space are so vast that you shouldn't exists.

Negative emotions are very useful in evolutionary sense. It's better to be anxious than dead or wounded.

Fear and axiety are the default state for mammals. A lab rat becomes calm rat only after it has explored it's cage and determined that it's safe.

You are calm in your environment only because you are reasonably certain it is safe. You construct a model for your environment and feel like you know how the environment works. And most of the time you are right.

Being challenged in a right way activates different genes. Perhaps the right way to live your life is to find wide variety of challenges.
The way you react to challenges mentally is that you change your model of the world to incorporate the problem and then you master it.

Individual is the primary. 

Most things are not rational. Men will go out of their way to prove to you that they are not rational.

Failures of christianity: 1. Search of truth, 2. emphasis on the afterlife
There is no truth and trying to search for it undermines the whole system.
Focus on afterlife is redundant since there is enough suffering in this world that needs to be addressed.

What if the struggle is what gives meaning to people? What if people will go out of their way to break the system, to cause chaos, to create suffering even if, and especially if, everything is provided for them.

When everything has been made easy, the only thing people will desire is difficulty. Then people will do anything to make things more difficult, and they are very good at that.
Maybe the only thing you are capable of is to make things more difficult. Maybe you need to be content with that. At least you are doing something, that is your mark on the world.

Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my own embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.
- Kierkegaard

If I believe that simplicity is a value in itself, I should try to make things simple. It doesn't matter even if I fail. I will not be judged by whether or not I succeed.
Journey before destination.
