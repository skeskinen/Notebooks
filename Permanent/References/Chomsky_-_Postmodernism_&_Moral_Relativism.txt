Postmodernism can be used to legitimize anything, since there is no good or bad, only narratives. Postmodernism is incredibly dangerous tool when used maliciously and can do tremendous damage. 

Everything in society is dependent on historical and cultural context. Everything is a social construction but is it actionable?

There are material benefits to adopting postmodernism. Intellectuals get to be relevant and have new grand ideas and theories.



Is it not true that different people can have the opposite views on morals? E.g. arabs don't see nazis as sensitive subject but are very protective of the prophet. Isn't it then true that morals are social construct and there are no objective morals? So we have to view morals as a relative and subjective thing.

Saying that science is relativist is kind of dumb. Sometimes science is wrong but there are self-correcting procedures that eventually notice where it went wrong and there will be new theories.

Moral questions are hard and it'll take time to determine what is the most just morality. E.g. slaves can be seen as more moral than wage labour since the slave owners have an incentive take better care of their slaves than employers do.

The biological models of the world that we form are not arbitrary. 
1. We learn them so easily that there must be innate structure.
2. The model has to approximate the real world. 
This structure means that we can find some common morality.
Over time there has been a tendency to allow more variation. E.g. more sexual behaviours, womens rights, equality. You could argue that this is progress and we are going towards more leniet morality that is closer to the true innate morality.
But these moral developments might be bad for the society. Maybe the old laws and taboos were actually well thought out. It might seem absurd but there is atleast a possibility that e.g. homosexuality actually leads to decadence. Relaxing the morals means that there is less common structure which the people can use in their ordinary lifes.
Maybe it is more useful to have very strict rigid moral code?
