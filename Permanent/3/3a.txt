Wisdom cannot be institutionalized.
When you try to formulate wisdom you end up describing a caricature of it. And it is very dependent on the context which means that the describition should change.
Religions are not flexible enough. They create power structures that are unchangeable after a while. And organized religion always distorts the message.
What is needed is a framework where people can find their own wisdom, a metamorality.
