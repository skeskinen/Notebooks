====== Writing libraries to be modified ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

Libraries shouldn't be finished products but templates that will be copied to the final project and modified to suit the needs of the user.

How would this change what the library authors do?
* Less edge case handling
* Less features
* More documentation around the core systems
* Different packaging
