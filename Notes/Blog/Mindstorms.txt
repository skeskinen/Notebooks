Review: Mindstorms by Seymour Papert

How do people learn?
Gears as thinking tool. Mapping ideas to physical world.
Does the problem fit your mode of thinking?
Learning is creation of knowledge.

What makes things learnable?
Structure of the problem. Splitting into parts.

Can we construct environments that facilitate learning?
Can computers become the ultimate learning tool?
Can students and teachers learn together in fun and engaging environment?

Mindstorms is a 1980 book by Seymour Papert, founder of the Learning Research Group at MIT Media Lab. The main topics are programming and math education and genetic epistemology, theory of learning established by Paperts mentor, Jean Piaget.
Pdf of the 1st edition is available online at Bret Victors website [worrydream.com](http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Mindstorms%201st%20ed.pdf).

Mindstorms is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in knowledge or learning. It gave me a lot more concrete understanding of Piaget's theories in a package that is much closer to my interests than Piaget's own writing.

4/5
