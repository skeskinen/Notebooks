Write for yourself.
You are the best judge of what interests you. Those things should interest you in the future as well. And you have probably forgotten all about it.

--------------------

Let silence be your general rule; or say only what is necessary and in few words. We shall, however, when occasion demands, enter into discourse sparingly, avoiding such common topics as gladiators, horse-races, athletes; and the perpetual talk about food and drink. Above all avoid speaking of persons, either in the way of praise or blame, or comparison. â€“ Epictetus


People seem to think they are entitled to someone engaging with the content they create. Everyone wants to be Youtube star or popular on Instagram so it follows that to be heard is a kind of human right. Your opinions or feelings have no value. They are not important to anyone. The most important thing about your creative output is that it needs to be valuable to someone. When you shout in to the void that is the Internet you are making a statement that your views and opinions matter; they don't.

Responsibility of the creators to make their work valuable.
* Valuable
* Persuasive
* Organized
* Clear

* Well written
* New knowledge
* Original
Doesn't matter, it needs to be important.

So why write at all?

Function of thinking, function of changing the world.

Proper manipulative writing requires that you speak in the language that resonates with your audience.
