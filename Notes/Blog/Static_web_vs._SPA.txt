====== SSR vs. CSR ======
Created Sunday 27 September 2020

spa vs. traditional model

Pros of CSR:
* Easier to make interactive sites, especially for interactions that don't require new data from server.
* Can begin to render the next page before the request completes.

Cons of CSR:
* You get sucked into Javascript world
* Initial load is slow so you often want SSR anyway
* SEO & SSR madness
* Fighting against the browser's model of addresses, pages & history 
* Typically leads to massive amounts of bloat
* Complicates the page logic, can lead to more requests that causes MORE load for the server.

Pro of SSR:
* Fast & Simple
* Works with Javascript blocked

Cons of SSR:
* Inefficiency around browser rendering the layout again and duplicate data
* File server needs to actual processing for templates & stuff
* Interactivity requires integrating Javascript into the pages
