* Why holistic understanding matters
* What the course teaches
	* How to build a simplistic but complete computer system
	* Give time estimates for different parts of the course
* Course  material with slides, Coursera, book
* Snake I made, show Hackenstein 3D
	* I would not want to do more complicated game because tooling
* Critique of tools. Educational system should do better.
* Conclusion
	* Provided a good framework for me to build my first compiler that goes from high level language all the way to assembly
	* Sometimes too simplistic. The resulting computer wouldn't be very useful expect as a novelty.
	* The complexity of the different parts of the system should be in balance. Now the compiler is doing all the lifting.
	* It would be interesting to build a similar computer for real on an FPGA.
