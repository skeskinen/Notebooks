I think most Bannerlord players would agree that the level progression of some skills in Bannerlord feels a bit off.
Trade has always felt particularly cruel to me, due to the trade perk tree having one of the most interesting perks locked behind 300 skill.
Steep increments in the exp requirements per level, together with your learning rate plummetting as you get near 300 mean that when you reach 270 skill, you are actually only about halfway through the grind. This can cause a lot of people to quit their 300 trade dreams at a point where they are so close but yet so far.

This is what makes 300 trade speederuns interesting to me. Just how quickly can you unlock this perk that has ended so many campaigns. 

So how can we actually get 300 trade in a speedrun?

Well the only way to gain trade exp is to do profitable trades. You gain 1 exp for every 2 denars of profit.

To reach 300 trade we'll need just about 5 million learning rate modified exp. With 5 focus points and 10 attribute points in social, this comes out to roughly 650 thousand exp (average learning rate 8.3x), or 1.3 million denars in profits. There is no way around this, you have to make a lot of trades or very large and profitable ones.


For maximum exp gain, we need a way to setup large profitable trades repeatedly. We need price manipulation.




You need money to make money. And also it would be great if you could get other people to do the work for you. In the case the work that needs doing is carrying loads of iron ore. The more we can carry, the faster we can train our trading skill.

It just happens that there is a perfect method that helps both with money and carrying goods, and it is available immediately at the beginning of the game. Getting married.
