* Why 300 trade is interesting and what 'everything has a price' does.
* What 300 trade requires?
	* 1.3 million denars in profits
	* 660k base xp
	* don't need to actually receive the money.
		* profits in denars -> forced to visit 1400 villages OR 150 caravans OR 28 cities.
			* Since we don't really care about the money, we can just keep doing trades the game thinks are profitable even when the opposing party cannot pay. I think that makes us the generous side of the transaction.
* How the prices work
	* buying and selling to a city changes the price, some goods are more or less sensitive
	* city internal supply & demand
	* villages and caravans prices
		* demonstrate exploiting caravans with irrelevant item, like flax
* How to get initial funds and a party that can carry the trade goods?
* Why we sell iron?
	* linked good
	* able to get more through smelting
	* able to visit 4 villages and go to sanala efficienctly
* Why start from Battania and end in Sanala?
* Execute the run
	* Each cycle we make almost 80,000 in profit
