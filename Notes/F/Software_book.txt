====== Software book ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

Writing software like writing a book.

Themes -> Requirements
Characters -> Components
Antagonist -> ? clients? external apis?

Writing process:
1) Write "notes"
2) Come up with central idea based on notes & research
3) Combine notes and edit the whole thing

Structure:
1) Introduction, establish requirements, components. Light read.
2) Conflict, hairy parts. Lowest point.
3) Resolution, conclusion, putting things together.


Having to rearrange your code into a story forces you to rethink about the code you wrote. It adds additional structure and cohesion. New edits have to fit the whole and find a place in the established story.

The story form gives new readers a logical order in which the software should be approached.
