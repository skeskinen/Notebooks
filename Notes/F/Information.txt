====== Information ======
Created Monday 14 September 2020

Presenting more information doesn't help. People are already drowning in information.

Everything you show should be actionable.

It should be a crime to show people something they don't need to see.

What people need are the means to act in case of a change in the environment.

"I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly quickening my activity."

To know what information is important, you need to know what your goals are. Then orient your search towards those goals. Without goals your are just searching blindly.
