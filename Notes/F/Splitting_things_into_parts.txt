====== Splitting things into parts ======
Created Friday 18 September 2020

Splitting things into parts is one of the fundamental ways to make something understandable.
It can be used as a learning technique; simple parts can be learned in isolation and collected into a whole.


There are multiple different ways to split any problem. Some of them make the whole simpler and others make it more complicated.

Ways of how splitting can make problem simpler:
* Pieces can be verified independently.
* Pieces can be reused.
* There is good separation between pieces. They make sense as categories.

Ways of how splitting can make problem more complicated:
* Pieces are not simple. E.g. they may have complicated interdependencies.
* Pieces can require complicated glue/runtime to work together.
