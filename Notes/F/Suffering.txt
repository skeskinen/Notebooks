====== Suffering ======
Created Sunday 11 October 2020

Life is suffering.

Following your dharma allows you to choose your own suffering to an extent.

Otherwise you are weak and aimless.


Choosing you own suffering is fundamental. E.g. decision to commit suicide brings good feeling. You take back control of your own life.

Rite of passage, liminal space, too easy life. People don't encounter enough suffering. They don't know how to deal with suffering. This leads to people who can't handle and can't choose their own suffering.
