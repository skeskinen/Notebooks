====== Making own tools ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

The biggest benefit of making your own tools is that you know how to repair, extend and modify them.

Usually the tools that you made yourself are not "professional quality". Most typically they are not as versatile as the off the shelf options. This can also be a positive thing since that means they can be simpler.

Beginners cannot be expected to make their own tools since they wouldn't know where to start.

It's interesting to think about differences in:
* Educational tools
	* Limited
	* Gives a clear direction
	* Artificial
* Professional tools
	* Very effective
	* Versatile
	* Complex
	* Often expensive
* Self-made tools
	* Most simple
	* Most effective


You wouldn't expect a carpenter to make their own drills or nails. But they do make their own mallets.
Blacksmiths often make a lot of custom tools.
