Intellect is fundamental human capability. Augmenting intellect means building tools that augment it.

Humanity has many problems that require complex solutions. Complex solutions require intellect; to build, to use, to maintain.

Finding ways to augment intellect is one of the most impactful things possible.

Success criteria:
* Some human need is fulfilled
* Able to think previously unthinkable thoughts
* Make something complex simpler

====== Communicating values ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Steve Jobs: Marketing is about values.
You have limited communication bandwidth to your customers. And they don't really care. So you make them care by communicating your values.

What do you want to communicate and how do you choose that?
Values - stories - knowledge - wisdom

All communication is to some extent marketing.

Fill your mind with action so that the action becomes effortless.

To achieve this you must first empty your mind.

====== Hierarchy of capabilities ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Doug Engelbart divided problem-solving capabilities into 2 groups:
* Basic capabilities
* Advanced capabilities built from the basic ones

It is worth more to augment the lower level ones since the effects will bubble up the hierarchy.

====== Human needs ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Human capabilities have been increased greatly.
Yet something like Aurelius' Meditations is still revevant.
We still need to be strong and vigilant so that the state is not corrupted by the mad king.

Most of the development is going in wrong directions.
We need to make damn sure that the things we do actually address the human needs.
And to do that we first have to make sure we know what those needs are.

Something like psychoanalysis or Maps of Meaning seems like the best answer.


E.g. people need spiritual growth but the progress has put them into an environment that stifles it.

====== Structure and representation ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Only structured knowledge can be represented cleanly and efficiently.

For unstructured knowledge the best you can do is a book.
Which is fine but books actually have a lot of structure, it's just not visible in the end product.

Unstructured knowledge becomes untagled mess that makes reading very hard.

====== Wisdom of the ancients ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

It is highly likely that what you need was known and is written somewhere.

The smart people of the past were actually really smart.

They also lived lives that were much harder.
