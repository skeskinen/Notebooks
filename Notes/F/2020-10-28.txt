====== Tao Te Ching continued ======

Now I'm pretty certain that ch41 intended reading is that the wise scholar is a pretender and you should try to be the fool.

====== Speculation and conquering nature ======

Earlier in the history of humans, we were restricted by nature. These people had different relationship with their resources. Defeating nature lead to emergence of speculation and speculators. Later this enabled manias and speculative bubbles.

====== Social technology ======

Social technology can be invented and used to alter behavior and natural tendencies. In a sense it is a form of transhumanism.

If we determine that too many people have explorer/conqueror nature and this is going to lead to destruction by climate change, we could theoretically develop a system that suppresses explorer behaviour.

E.g. we could have a mega cycle that says that for the next 200 years we'll collectively go back to primitive society.

Conversation between Noam Chomsky and Fabian Scheidler 

The narrative that stone ages were violent and we needed state systems to get us out of the state of nature is wrong.
Tyranny was invented with the state.

4 Types of tyranny:
1. Physical power
2. Structural violence. Property relationships, wage labour, etc.
3. Ideological power
4. Tyranny of linear thinking. Way of thinking that sees people, societies, nature as controllable, commandable.
