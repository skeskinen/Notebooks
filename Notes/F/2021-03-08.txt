====== Software and industry ======

Software development is like early industrialism in the sense that it is still spreading to all sorts of domains where it can make an impact. There is underemphasis on core tech and standards since there is still growth to be had.

There is still hope that much of the technology stack can be replaced in some future technology cycle. In theory we could even have a second software related industrial revolution.
