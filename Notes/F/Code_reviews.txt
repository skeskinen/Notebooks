====== Code reviews ======
Created Thursday 03 September 2020

Should thoughts require approval before they can be added to the organization's knowledge base?

Pro: Curation is important. People often don't realize how bad their writing is. Requiring a second opinion filters a lot of garbage. Reviews increase the likelihood that inserted thoughts fit the whole system.
Cons: Reviews take time. Reviewer might not understand the thought, suggested changes can make it worse. Context switching the reviewer to correct mindset for the CL takes a lot of energy. Low quality thoughts are fine if they are WIP, allowing iteration and change is important.
Neutral: Author needs to prove that CL has some "objective" quality. This can be useful excercise or massive waste of time.

Conclusion: All thoughts need to be validated at some point. Code review like system can be useful in the validation process. However it is important that the granularity of reviewing is appropriate. E.g. it would be impossible to write a epic fantasy novel if every change and 'micro-draft' required approval.
Sometimes it's ok to commit low quality artifacts but there needs to be a process that makes sure that keeping them is in the best interest of the organization. 



What about:
* Reviewing yourself after some time (e.g. +4d, +2w).
* Collect multiple changes into one review set.
* Review on next write.
* Review popup next time when opened.
