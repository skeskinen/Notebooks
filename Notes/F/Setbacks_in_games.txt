====== Setbacks in games ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

Players don't like it when a game does something to hinder them. It feels unfair and often random.

It is much better if you can structure the game so that players themselves cause the problems by messing up.

Good: failing simcity in SC
Bad: Traps in nethack
Neither: Biters in Factorio, still feels kinda random
