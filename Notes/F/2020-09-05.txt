Getting bored is a sign that some part of you doesn't accept what you are doing. Somewhere inside yourself you feel that you should be doing something else.

When you are getting bored you should ask what it is that you want to accomplish and do your actions contribute towards those things.


**Bureucracy**

Bureaucratic procedures are built by people to solve problems that they had. So they are in designed in this sense. Most Bureucracies are fine as long as the tasks they face and the environment around them stays approximately the same.

On a more holistic level, bureaucracies are not designed. No-one can predict how all the conflicts at different levels of organization will manifest themselves. Or what bandaid (hack) will be but in place to fix the immediate problem. 

Once you have enough abstraction/indirection it is very easy not to notice that two goals are in direct conflict. Any programmer can tell you that this will happen even in surprisingly simple systems and even if you have only one designer. The advantage of being the lone designer is that you should have the ability to change the underlying assumptions behind the goals.


====== Gradual decline ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2020

The decline of civilizations appears gradual because the dysfunctional institutions are cannibalizing the functional ones. This process can be quite slow if the functional ones are sizable at the beginning of the process. Over time the dysfunctional parts of the society consume larger and larger percentage of the total productive capacity. There are at least a few necessary conditions for this process to continue:
1) The dysfunctional institutions have to viewed as necessary. I.e. "The banks are too big to fail".
2) Their faults cannot be so obvious that they are unhidable from the public. This is usually easy as all complex institutions are good at hiding their true colors.
3) The dysfunctional institutions have enough leverage over the people in power so that they keep feeding the institutions more and more.
4) They lack either the ability or will to correct their course. This is almost given from the definition of dysfunctional institution.

This process of cannibalization will manifest as inequality and loss of society's capabilites. As more and more functional institutions are destroyed, things that used to be possible become too expensive or just unobtainable. 

====== How to read ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2020

The reason we read is to understand things and to get new ideas.

A good way to make sure you are actually processing what you read is to imagine you are having a dialog with the writer. Pause after every paragraph or page and try to explain to the writer what you think he meant. If you feel the explanation has value to you then make a note of it and make the thought your own.

====== Outlining ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2020

Outlining is the only way to make sure your writing makes sense on multiple levels.

An outline should be 10-15 sentenses. If your text is very long the outline can be hierarchical. In this case the top level should still have 10-15 items.

Start with an outline and write your text to match it. After your draft is finished, make a new outline and copy the relevant parts from the previous draft to each heading. If some parts don't have a place in the new outline you can scrap those as irrelevant.
