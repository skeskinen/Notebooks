====== Challenge ======

Key to optimal experience is reframing things as challenges.

Taking a shower? Can I take a shower virtuously? Can I extract more enjoyment out of the shower? Can I be more relaxed than usual?

Finding a purpose? Can I find a more meaningful goals than before? Can I have a better sense of my strengths and weaknesses than before?

Feeling depressed? Can I still enjoy myself even when down? Can I get out of it quicker than usual? Can I do simple useful things even when feeling awful?

If something feels too hard, remember to make the goals simple enough. Split the tasks until they are trivial. 
If something feels easy, it's ok to keep the tasks larger.

Meta: Can I make the level of challenge match my skills better? Can I add appropriate amount of mindfulness to each activity to make anything engaging?
