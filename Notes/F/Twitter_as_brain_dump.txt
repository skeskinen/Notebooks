====== Twitter as brain dump ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

Writing for the sake of writing.
Is there value in text that is never read? This goes back to writing as a thinking tool.
The threshold for sharing something is quite high. Most people don't share random thoughts. Maybe twitter works like this. But you need a decent following before anyone will seriously encage with your text.
Twitter is not really designed for developing thougts. But it is a platform with low friction thought sharing.
