====== Outlining ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2020

Outlining is the only way to make sure your writing makes sense on multiple levels.

An outline should be 10-15 sentenses. If your text is very long the outline can be hierarchical. In this case the top level should still have 10-15 items.

Start with an outline and write your text to match it. After your draft is finished, make a new outline and copy the relevant parts from the previous draft to each heading. If some parts don't have a place in the new outline you can scrap those as irrelevant.
