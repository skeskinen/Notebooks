====== Private and public morals ======

When Jesus says to "turn the other cheek" or "giving unto caesar", that is coming from his private morals.

There are separate public morals that are more suitable to politicians and other policy makers. These have to make assuptions that people are selfish etc.

====== Postmodern truth ======

Postmodernism is uninteresting as philosophy because they don't have any axioms.

You should at least pick axioms that enable interesting observations about the world.
Those axioms might as well be called truth since they are 1) necessary for intelligent discussions 2) universally accepted

Other schools of philosophy have painstakingly chosen some truths and are justifiably irritated at postmodernists.

====== The Dao and homeostasis ======

Many philosophies accept change and say it is inevitable. But people often fail to use this observation in their daily life and actions.
Maybe something like daoism would be the proper framework for people to start accepting non-homeostatic states of daily life.


====== Human nature, positivity and private+public faces ======

We need to recognize the deficiencies in human nature that lead us to construct society that is self-destructing. At the same time we need to believe that humans are resourceful enough to solve all the current problems.

This is similar situation that we have with private and public morals. Outward we need to be positive so that we can be solution oriented. Inward we need to be reflective and think hard about our failures.

Universities and other intellectual communities should be able to remind us about the bad parts. This will be our private face.
We can't afford to actually believe our public face.

====== Good times and prepping ======

People don't save during the good times. This is a major issue. It is important reason why Keynesian politics don't work. 
Saving should be viewed as a virtuous activity by the society. Saving is important part of self-reliance and freedom. Indebted man should be viewed as non-free.

Also being able to give up existing comforts and benefits should somehow be part of the culture.

Cycles could be important part of solving these issues. E.g. we could have part of the cycle were there are no social benefits etc.

====== Plato and believing the public ======

Plato didn't believe in democracy. Does that mean that he would think that evil men need to be controlled?
Democracy means acknowledging that evil men have a say in the polis.

====== Preventing shitty changes ======

How did US constitution become a joke? They had some pretty good stuff in there.
Why did US culture change so much from rugged individualism to the modern consumption culture.

Why do people gradually care more and more about the federal level and less about state&county levels of politics?
Politicians have an incentive to consolidate power, but people should still focus on the local level.

Should we try to save the future generations from themselves?
“I am increasingly persuaded that the earth belongs exclusively to the living and that one generation has no more right to bind another to it's laws and judgments than one independent nation has the right to command another.” 
— Jefferson

What is government but putting in to the effect the lessons which we have learned in dealing with the contradictions in our characters.
— HBO John Adams
