====== Power of politics ======

When politicians lose their power, people start to ignore politics. They try to circumvent political decision making by creating groups and spaces that exist outside political power. This weakens the politics further and leaves it open for small interest groups.

It would be better for society in the long run if the energy of young rebels could be used to strenghten the political system.

====== Independent cyberspace ======

Internet was never fair, free, distributed or anarchic meritocratic federation. Humans will create hierarchies of power and control where ever they go. We need laws and politics to mitigate the unwanted effects of human contradictions.

Utopian cyberspace as a place of freedom of expression and ideas 	was a naive fantasy.
