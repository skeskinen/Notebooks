====== Wei Wu Wei ======

Be what you want to be. Do what you want to do. Manifest intent. Do not doing.
Philosophy is lived every moment. Reading books is just to get instructions.

====== Requirements for life ======

There are two things you need for orienting your life: Self-control to manifest your intent and wisdom to set good intents.
A philosopher doesn't so much as lift a finger without a good reason.

====== Doctor and philosopher ======

Just as a doctor should be able to tell a sick man how to get better physically, a philosopher should be able to tell them how to get better mentally.
A philosopher who can't tell people how to think is a useless philosopher.

====== Stoics and control ======
Stoics are wrong about emotions and feelings like pain. They can be controlled so they are not indifferences. Wim Hof shows that you can be in tune with your body. Body is not indifference.

====== Stoics and struggle ======
Epictetus admits that the stoic ideal is not a natural state but something you have to work hard at to maintain. It'll be hard to be free and successful at the same time and Epictetus suggests picking one or the other.
