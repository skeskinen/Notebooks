====== Split government and non-profits ======

Splitting tax revenues into multiple categories can decrease the influence that politicans have on public spending.
A large portion of public budget should be paid directly by citizens to non-profits that will manage roads, social security programs, etc.

This would reduce potential spots for corruption. And it would work nicely with more local orgs since the locals would prefer to invest in their local institutions and infrastructure.

====== Decomplexifying ======

Decomplexifying system often requires some shock to the environment.
E.g. nature and evolution tends to favor more complex solutions when conditions are relatively stable. Stable conditions favor exploitation, which implies efficiency and complexity. Unstable conditions favor adaptability I.e. simplicity.

It would be preferrable if we could decomplexify gradully, by removing requirements.
