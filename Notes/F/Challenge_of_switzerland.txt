====== Challenge of switzerland ======
Created torstai 01 lokakuu 2020

Coming to Switzerland was a mental challenge. But I didn't really feel that way.

In some sense it was too easy, but that's not really a good description. I didn't even engage with the "problem". And it's not fair to say it was too easy because I didn't even try.

Why are some "problems" more engaging than others? Is choosing to ignore a problem a good thing, part of focusing on the important stuff?
