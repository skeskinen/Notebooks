It is not likely that there are any incremental improvements in programming languages that would give 2x boost in productivity. This is the topic of the famous Silver Bullet text.

There is however the possibility that complete paradigm shift could give these results. Something that enables completely new ways of thinking, working or representing.

If the change is drastic enough it would severely disrupt people's ability to work. I'm of the opinion that any system that can bring significant performance would likely require lots of re-training that people don't want to do. It is very annoying to change your work patterns. How would you market something like that? In a lot of ways this is the problem that functional programming faces, altho functional programming is not revolutionary enough for this discussion.

I think education platforms are the best way to market new programming paradigms. If you can show that kids are able to do amazing things in your environment, then people will have to accept it's merits. Make a system where average teen can solve some really hard problems.
