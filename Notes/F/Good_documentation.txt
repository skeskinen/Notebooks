====== Good documentation ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

Good documentation has three parts:
* Tutorials
* Descriptions of major topics and concepts
* Reference

The main purpose of documentation is to teach. You'll need to think about the starting level and development of the reader.

You should have an idea of what your readers want to do. Then come up with a plan of how to teach the reader to do that thing.

You should also:
* Link what you explain to other things you explain and how they combine.
* Tell why the things you teach are useful and what can be built on top of them.
* Explain how the material will improve the understanding of the reader.
