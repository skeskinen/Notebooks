Knowledge is inseparable from learning. Studying learning is studying the structure of the problem.

The big question in education is to what extent is knowledge modular. How can you split things into smaller and smaller chunks. Once you know the structure of the problem it should be easier to come up with environments for learning each part.

E.g. Numbers have order, proximity to other numbers, arithmetic, different representations, they are copyable etc.
