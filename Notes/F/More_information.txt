====== More information ======
Created Monday 14 September 2020

If you have a complex system, the more information you cather about it, the crazier you become.

You think you know more and cather more info, but all of that doesn't help your decision making one bit. In the end the best you can do is guess, which you could have done just as well completely blindly.

The correct way to manage a complex situation is to be flexible and adaptable. Don't try to predict the future but be ready to thrive in as many of the possible endstates as possible.
