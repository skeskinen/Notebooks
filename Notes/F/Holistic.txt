====== Holistic ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

Holisticism is always some sort of sham.
The distinction between environment and the thing you are focusing on is arbitrary. You cannot think holistically about the whole universe.

Reductionist approach is to isolate pieces that have well defined observable states and have clear "API" or good separation of concerns. Of course this is also a sham sinse you always have some "cross cutting corcerns" that break your compartmentalization.
