====== Project updates 1-on-1 ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

Instead of doing group updates, maybe there should be 2^n tiny 1-on-1 meetings.
If it is done online the overhead can be minimized.

Compared to group meetings the presenters time is "wasted" since they have to present the same thing to everyone. Listeners time spent stays the same.
I see large benefits from personalization of the content, better ability to ask details and better feedback for the presenter.

I think it makes sense that juniors present to smaller audiences. They get practise and their time is not as expensive.
