====== Simplicity ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

Simplicity is our only weapon in the fight against complexity that'll collapse the civilization.

Everything you do has some sort of high level spec and the artifact you produce has to conform to that spec. Even if there is no formal spec there is some reason why the thing you made exists. 
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

In fields such as physics, oversimplification is often more common than excess complexity. This might mean that if there is no model that is simple enough to understand for humans, the result is useless. Then you have to give up or trust that later there will be some better way to represent the results.
