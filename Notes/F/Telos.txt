====== Telos ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

Telos is Aristotle's concept of purpose or goal. According to aristotle all objects have a proper function. To thrive means to act accordingly to your proper function. Usually the proper functioning means using you capabilities to their fullest. A happy cat is one that functions like a cat; jumping, stalking, climbing, etc.

Aristotle thought that what separates humans from animals is reason and use of language.
And for sure, these are things that humans are pretty good at compared to most other animals.

But I'd add that humans are made to build and use tools.
