====== Purpose ======

I can have all the mental clarity in the world, complete acceptance and constant flow, but to what end?

Does anything I do matter, and what does it even mean to ask that question? If I determine that it's a meaningless question, then what?
Just keep practising meditation, flow, stoicism and loving the world? If everything can be done virtuously, why do anything at all?

It's pretty clear that there is no purpose. The goal is to build yourself in spite of this realization.
What is the best thing you can build out of the material you have been given?
