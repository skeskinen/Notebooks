====== Code Reviews ======

Should thoughts require approval before they can be added to the organization's knowledge base?

Pro: Curation is important. People often don't realize how bad their writing is. Requiring a second opinion filters a lot of garbage. Reviews increase the likelihood that inserted thoughts fit the whole system.
Cons: Reviews take time. Reviewer might not understand the thought, suggested changes can make it worse. Context switching the reviewer to correct mindset for the CL takes a lot of energy. Low quality thoughts are fine if they are WIP, allowing iteration and change is important.
Neutral: Author needs to prove that CL has some "objective" quality. This can be useful excercise or massive waste of time.

Conclusion: All thoughts need to be validated at some point. Code review like system can be useful in the validation process. However it is important that the granularity of reviewing is appropriate. E.g. it would be impossible to write a epic fantasy novel if every change and 'micro-draft' required approval.
Sometimes it's ok to commit low quality artifacts but there needs to be a process that makes sure that keeping them is in the best interest of the organization. 



What about:
* Reviewing yourself after some time (e.g. +4d, +2w).
* Collect multiple changes into one review set.
* Review on next write.
* Review popup next time when opened.


====== Patterns of thinking ======

Codifying thoughts. There must be some patterns of arguments that repeat. 
Codifying those patterns would be one way of transferring knowledge.
Codified thinking patterns can be repeated.


You need to know what you want to be thinking about. Once you know what you want to think about you can choose the right thinking pattern.
People who are skilled at using formalised patterns of thinking can choose the right one for the issue.
This is what people mean when they say they think with paper. They have more organized system for thinking.
It starts with knowing what you want to think about.

Pick a toping and write on it 3 times from 'positive', 'negative' and 'neutral' point of view. Then analyze each stance and write conclusion.


====== Leaving something unfinished ======
Created Thursday 03 September 2020

Placeholder in thought.

Mark something as something to be filled later. This will be important for anything complicated.

This is important for getting something actually done.

It will be easier to fill the holes later when you find something interesting or some other idea fills them naturally.
