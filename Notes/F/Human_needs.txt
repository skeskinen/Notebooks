====== Human needs ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Human capabilities have been increased greatly.
Yet something like Aurelius' Meditations is still revevant.
We still need to be strong and vigilant so that the state is not corrupted by the mad king.

Most of the development is going in wrong directions.
We need to make damn sure that the things we do actually address the human needs.
And to do that we first have to make sure we know what those needs are.

Something like psychoanalysis or Maps of Meaning seems like the best answer.


E.g. people need spiritual growth but the progress has put them into an environment that stifles it.
