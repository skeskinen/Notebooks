====== Postmodernism and association chains ======

Association chains between signs are not infinite and they are not random. They form a graph that has loops and other structure. This structure is closely related with reality.

====== The cognitive function and the manipulative function ======

Knowledge can be used to understand the world or to change the world.
These two functions are both important and correspond roughly with modern worldview and post-modern worldview.

====== Reflexivity, manipulative function and social sciences ======

In social sciences the results are reflexive.
When we try to falsify a social science theory we need to make sure that the people acted in a way that matches the assumptions of the theory.
This makes the results weaker but it doesn't fundamentally change the way that social sciences operate.
