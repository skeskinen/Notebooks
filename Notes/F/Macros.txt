====== Macros ======
Created Saturday 12 September 2020

Macros allow you to implement some things that are typically in compilers by yourself. The cost is that usually your macros have worse usability or performance than language level features.

Macros are just one tool among others. They are useful insofar they allow you to represent your ideas in code. 

Custom DSLs are often cleaner solution than code filled with macros. You can implement your own interepreter with (hopefully) better errors and simple semantics.

Macros have some interesting metaprogramming properties that would make Hofstadter proud, I think. But I'm not really sure how much expressive power they truly give to a language. How often do you do self references in your writing? Your next sentence is: Not very often.
