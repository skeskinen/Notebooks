====== People and toughness ======
Created torstai 01 lokakuu 2020

It seems like people these days complain about everything. And it seems people are very sensitive.

But are people really more sensitive today than in the past? Maybe social media etc. just makes it seem like that. There is always someone complaining about everything.

Something like Black rights movement has faced roughly the same amount of hardships with roughly the same amount of activicism for a long time.

Maybe people always think that people in the past were tougher? Did medieval people think that people of the antique were tougher?
At the same time, when you look at something like the practise of duels, it's hard to argue that modern people are tough. Our lives are so easy!

People say that late Rome was decadent. If those reports are true then there should be meaninful plot of decadence of cultures that would show actual changes between years/generations.
