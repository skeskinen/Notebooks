====== Nonduality continued ======

Nonduality starts with the question "What am I?". This question is meant to lead you to gain better understanding of your awareness.
You might begin to understand the essense of your being. "Know your own essense. When you know your own essense, then you know the essense of all things. That art thou."

====== Ideal ======

Build an ideal of the greatest good that you could do. Work towards that ideal and all the other things will be provided for you. Then you are seeking the kingdom of heaven.
The ideal needs to be concrete enough that you can aim towards it.
