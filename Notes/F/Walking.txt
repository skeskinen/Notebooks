====== Walking ======
Created Wednesday 02 September 2020

Utilize the two springs in your legs:
* Feet and ankle
* Knees

You need to be relaxed enough to allow your legs to store and release energy. Optimal walking is almost effortless.

Practically: You need to let your knees bend in your walking cycle.
