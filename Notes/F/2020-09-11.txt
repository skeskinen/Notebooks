====== Liberalism ======


True liberty means that people have control over the organizations and not the other way around.
All organizations have to be responsible to the people. Both governments and corporations.
Left-liberalism is not about redistributing wealth or equality or any of that. It is about making sure that people are in control of the means of production and subjects to anyone or anything. Sometimes this will mean redistributing wealth if that wealth doesn't serve the peple. You can have corporations with multiple levels of management hierarchies as long as that hierarchy is justified. The leaders need to be qualified for their jobs and responsible to the people beneath them.
Of course it would be bad if people just kept destroying the existing organizations for the sake of destroying them. There needs to be some checks and balances in every system. There needs to be some process for determing if you are justified in toppling your manager.

====== Pursuit of ignorance ======
