====== Hardware is the problem ======

When solving sweeping issues like loss of meaning, globalization or climate change, people tend to abstract away the context where the problem exists. Solving the problem then becomes a mental excercise that has little to do with the reality.
This is similar to how people approach problems in computer science. You construct a theoretical model of the environment and solve the problem in that theoretical environment. This solution is typically too abstract or inefficient to be useful in the real world.
People don't see that the context is the problem. The problem is what to do inside the constraints set by the environment.
