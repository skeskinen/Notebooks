====== Philosophers and psychiatrists ======
Philosophers are supposed to tell people how to think. In our age this function has been transferred to psychiatrists and self-help authors.
I think it is because philosophy got way out of hand and is no longer useful for most people.

====== Awards ======
Awards give a signal that distinguishes which actions are most highly valued in the system. People can infer much of the expected behaviour from who is respected and who is not.

====== Education and discipline ======
Much of the education system in place is dedicated to instilling discipline in the children in the hopes that they'll one day become productive workers. The process is modelled after similar systems used in armies previously.
A self actualized person would do the work required of him without the need for such discipline for they are their own guardian. It might be more useful to try to foster spiritual growth instead of discipline but it is unclear how well that would scale.
