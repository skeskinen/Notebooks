====== Mentality of changing things ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

You need to be able to change things around you.
A lot of people get stuck in the mental spaces they build for themselves.
Just staying in the same place is easy. Even if it hurts.

This feels similar to the liberation you get from building your own tools.
You are not bound by what other people have done or think is right.

Part of the culture I want is that people have ability to think for themselves, to own things and make meaningful changes. I believe that is required so that people can take pride in their work. You have to lead by example and be ready to make major changes.

Code fearlessly. Ask for forgiveness not permission.

Hire smart people and make them responsible for the things they do.

Computer science is supposed to be only limited by what people can come up with. But people are limited by the thoughts that have been thought before.
