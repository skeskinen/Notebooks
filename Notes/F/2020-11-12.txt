====== Altruism and context ======

Is hand altruistic towards the body when it is useless and draining resources?

====== Climate activism and the identity of activists ======

Environmental values should not become end in themselves. We can't have people who care too much about activism because they have incentives not to fix things so they can keep complaining.

I can see this tendency in my self regarding pessimism and contrarian ideas. I often want to see popular approaches fail so I don't do things properly.

====== Effective communication ======

How do you actually change people? Reinforcement theory and selective exposure etc. cognitive deficiencies state that it is pretty hard to effectively change people's views.

Before you become effective communicator you should be fairly confident in your views. How can anyone be that confident?


====== Negative identities ======

Every positive view has fuzzier and weaker negative view and similarly each negative view has weaker positive view.

Negative identities are often kind of toxic in complicated ways, see e.g. climate activism topic above, feminism, contrarian views.

“I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.” 

Nietzsche doesn't want to accuse, doesn't want to build a negative identity. He will leave his mark on the world through the positive.
Effort spend on the ugly, obsolete parts is wasted effort.
A new theory should not refute all the existing theories. It should be complete and coherent in itself.

Some improvements need to be incremental. But even then you can think of incremental improvements as new parts of the system. In those new parts you should focus on what is good and beautiful. Affirm the good parts, become a Yes-sayer.


Building things is much harder than critique. Building a positive identity is much harder than building negative ones.
I think this is what Peterson means when he says that "Universities are never-land. They let you think you are something when you are actually nothing." 
In school & university you can do well just with critique. You don't need a positive identity nor is it necessarily beneficial to your academic career.
Eventually you become a doctoral student or professor and are expected to produce new things. But the transformation can be jarring.

Chomsky on true education: Being able to create without external input, to ask the right questions, to search, research and answer questions. To be a productive and creative human being. E.g. creating a positive identity.

====== The craft of writing effectively ======

cognitive function, manipulative function

Postmodernism, lacan and being learned indiviual. Postmodern nazi authoritarian. Positive side of postmodernism? Use the manipulative function to change the world.

Tell readers that they are wrong so that they think the writing is valuable. Is this really a good idea? Won't they just use their selective exposure to ignore the writing?

Creative output needs to be valuable.

Generality, continuity bad, contradiction good ?  Moving forward from instability. Wisdom in removing things.

I often read stuff to figure out if the reader knows what they are talking about??
