Another structured editor.
Since this is educational purposes, the focus is on reducing syntax errors and ease of learning.
They have their own language which looks reasonable but is full of Java madness.

True test for structured editor is how easy it is to do larger edits. Since this is educational project that isn't the main focus. The editability is still much much better than Scratch.
Readability-wise the frames look pretty good. Color coding, light syntax, auto indent and spacing etc.

I'm unsure about sans serif. I think there is practical value in the simplicity of monospace and enables some advanced edits such as block edit to work a lot better. Possible reading speed benefits and aesthetic improvements of other fonts need to be quite considerable for this tradeoff to be worth it.
