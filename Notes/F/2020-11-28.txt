====== Cargo cult science ======

Great spiritual leaders through the ages have struggled with communicating their ideas. They have to simplify the teaching for communication purposes but their followers will misinterpret the teaching. They could be following the letter but not the spirit.
Dao that can be named is not the eternal Dao.

====== Success of modernity and values ======

Science has been relatively successful doctrine because it is a procedure that can be followed. You can follow the steps and end up with a result that is relatively easy to verify. 
Success of science was self-perpetuating. Success leads to more resources and brain power.

Modernity has clear and powerful view of scientific epistemology. The effectiveness of it doesn't leave room for truth outside science. This is why modernity can't have strong values or morals. 

Postmodernity rejects the scientific epistemology but doesn't really offer anything comparable in return.
Yet clearly there are things that are true but science can't prove them. E.g. one engineering technique is better than other, which piece of art is more meaningful or what is ethical.

Creation of meta-moral is largely a project in epistemology. You'd need a process for finding the things that are good and a process for separating good from evil.


====== Procedural epistemology ======

I think there is something valuable in the intersection of Hoflstadter's strange loop thinking, procedural knowledge & epistemology, genetic epistemology and meta-morality.

This could be the direction in which I'm supposed to look for my unifying project. But it should also include some of the naturalistic aspects and ideas of simplicity and flow.
