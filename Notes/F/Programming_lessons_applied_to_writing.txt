====== Programming lessons applied to writing ======
Created Wednesday 02 September 2020

* DRY
	* Good text doesn't repeat same ideas too much. There might be a central topic, but the at least the angle needs to change.
	* Fiction writers make sure not to overuse any words.
* Keep it simple, stupid. Best text is direct and light. Less is more.


* Semantic compression
	* Harder to see how it can be applied to writing.
	* It would be extremely valuable if somehow possible.
	* Achieving semantic compression might be the whole point of Zettelkasten.
	* Requires: Finding similar thoughts, extracting them, leaving behind references.
	* Identifying similarities from writing sounds really hard.
	* References make reading hard. Zettelkasten writers collect their works into something readable.
