By writing stuff down, you are infinitely closer to publishing your work than if you have nothing.

Question then becomes, does your work have enough value to be published. Which is much better than having nothing at all.

Publishing is important. You need feedback or some sort of evaluation of thoughts.
Just telling yourself that you might publish something should make you intellectually more careful and ambitious. It will help you even if never publish one line of your writing. After all you are your own most important critic.
