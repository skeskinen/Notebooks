Meaning can become a prison. You feel like you have to do something but you don't want to do it.
You can argue that is not freedom.
But hindu/asian religions would probably say that doing what you have to do is more important than whether or not you want to do it.

Nietzsche: Life is deceitful. Those who seek truth are life-denying

Existentialism: meaning is personal, truth can be subjective. Postmodernism: there is no truth

Individualism is the responsible choice. You have to put the responsibility on the individuals. Collectivism leads to chaos.

The individual doesn't have to be responsible for the values. Values can be created in a collective process.

Value is not tied to success. You can be righteous even when you fail and sin.


Apprenticeships and existentialism.
People have to decide their trade, their skills, their passion, before they have a chance to find themselfs or the truth inside themselves.
There isn't any economic incentive to let people find themselves. And maybe the commitment to a trade is necessary for finding yourself. You certainly learn a lot more just by doing than theorizing.
You can't separate the self from roles. The roles have to come from the society.
Some people might reject all the roles, but that's fine too. Then their role will be that of a rebel.

These days we don't even try to provide a frame for people. What we should do instead is to force upon people a rigid frame and then provide enough opportunities for changing that frame when it becomes tiring.

Why does Peterson think postmodernism is collectivist? Why is there overlap between postmodern and marxist thinkers?
