====== Writing libraries to be modified ======

Libraries shouldn't be finished products but templates that will be copied to the final project and modified to suit the needs of the user.

How would this change what the library authors do?
* Less edge case handling
* Less features
* More documentation around the core systems
* Different packaging

====== Software book ======
Created Sunday 13 September 2020

Writing software like writing a book.

Themes -> Requirements
Characters -> Components
Antagonist -> ? clients? external apis?

Writing process:
1) Write "notes"
2) Come up with central idea based on notes & research
3) Combine notes and edit the whole thing

Structure:
1) Introduction, establish requirements, components. Light read.
2) Conflict, hairy parts. Lowest point.
3) Resolution, conclusion, putting things together.


Having to rearrange your code into a story forces you to rethink about the code you wrote. It adds additional structure and cohesion. New edits have to fit the whole and find a place in the established story.

The story form gives new readers a logical order in which the software should be approached.
