====== Morality ======

Morality has object and a subject. An action can be moral towards one and amoral agains another. When thinking of morality you should think of the different scopes of identity. Self - family - community - nation - humanity - world. In case of a conflict it's typically better to prefer the wider definitions.

Jasnah and the robbers in the alleyway: Jasnah's action was moral on all levels except towards herself. It was beneficial to her acquitances and good for the city.
Is life preferable to death? Yes
Is lawfulness preferable to unlawfulness? Yes
Is dividing power preferable to vigilantism? Yes
Was it Jasnah's duty to go to the alley? No
So she sacrificed her principles to benefit others. Such a sacrifice might be worth it but one needs to be careful.

====== Manifest intent ======

Manifesting intent is one the most important skills you can have. This is one of the main goals of the stoic life project, but I'm not sure they approach it from the right angle. I think Dr. K's approach is better. You should learn to negotiate with yourself, not gain tyranny over your body.
Besides you can't actually tyrannize your body. Body precedes mind. If you feel like shit there is no way you can overcome that with willpower. The stoics are just misguided in this. Just thyroid malfunction or any other disease of the mind is enough to make thinking impossible.
What actually works is focusing on the present, on the things you can do next. Being the best you can in each moment.
