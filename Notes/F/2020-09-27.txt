====== Coming back to things ======

In meditation you have to accept that you will have thoughts but the important part is to return to the thing you are meditating on.

I feel similar process should happen on a larger scale with all the distractions/addictions you have. E.g. youtube/games/movies.
When you practice getting your desires under control, you should notice and accept the lapses. No judgement, just notice and return to your commitment.

If the analogy with meditation makes sense it should get easier to return and the lapses should become shorter as you practice.

====== Intuition ======
Created Sunday 27 September 2020

Best learning happens when you encounter something that challenges your intuition. Rote learning without changes in intuition is not worth much since that knowledge is unlikely to build associations with other things in our mind. It will not be available for effective analogy making.

Most convicing arguments are ones that create obvious inconsistencies in intuitive thinking.


====== Programming literacy ======
Created Sunday 27 September 2020

Programming is the art of procedures.

All of elementary school math has more to do with programming than math. School math is just memorizing and executing procedures.

Learning programming proper makes procedures into tangible things that can be reasoned about. It can be very powerful tool for meta thinking. Ideally children would learn to spot and fix bugs in their procedures and routines outside of programming.
