The solution to world's problems is not to turn everything into service and make people even more dependent on the system.
It doesn't solve the root causes of consumerism and would just make people treat objects even worse than when they own them.

The solution is rugged individualism and people doing their own part to fix the world's problems.


====== Collapse and interest groups ======

In normal conditions only the people in power can make changes and it is hard to change who is in power.

Collapse is an event that can change existing interest groups and their balance of power or create new ones. This change makes bigger changes possible as the new powerful have different interests.
E.g. communist uprising creates new interest groups along the marxist analysis, proletariat & capitalists and redistributes the power to the communist party.

====== Local maxima ======

If you actually want to create a better world and fix stuff your ideas need to form a coherent whole that will inspire people.
As mentioned above, collapse is a good time implement larger changes so it should not be "wasted".

Incremental changes will serve the current powers and ever if they are actually good they can't bring you out of local maxima. Incremental changes just fix immediate problems.
Politics is like playing chess where you can't see beyond your next move.
