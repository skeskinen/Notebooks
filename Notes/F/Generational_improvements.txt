====== Generational improvements ======
Created Monday 14 September 2020

Each generation should build a learning environment that is slightly better than the last one.
Most of the great computer scientists are over 80 or dead. Computer science has advanced but slowly. I'd imagine most people in the field are unhappy with the progress.

Engelbart's law, we need to get better at getting better.

People thought that we can just skip stages and build on top of abstractions. We were too greedy and went too fast.

Instead we should find ways to build better learning environments for the stuff that exists already.

Each new generation should learn the fundamentals more efficiently.
