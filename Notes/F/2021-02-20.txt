====== HRE and travelling capital, consolidating power ======

The power structure of HRE was extremely complicated and non-linear. It was created and maintained by personal relationships between the feudal lords.
HRE didn't have one stable capital. There was no pressure to consolidate power to one place (before Habsburgs). There was no bureaucrats or career politicans.

When people are lost and seek unity, it makes sense to consolidate power. But consolidation does not bring unity. It brings power struggle.
