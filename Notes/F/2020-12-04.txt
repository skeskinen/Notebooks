freedom vs. order

====== Left or right Nietzsche ======

Nietzche wanted moral refoms/change/progress/revaluation&questioning of morals?  This makes Nietzsche leftist?
No, he wanted that great men define their own morals based on nature. Conservatists can say that those morals will always be the same since nature is constant.

This is central issue with the left. Starting with Foucault, they want to change the morals to something incomprehensible.
You can be Nietzschean with conservative values.

====== Strength ======

Don't make people less anxious, make them braver and stronger.

Vata dosha is sensitive to cold: you should train cold resistance and at the same time keep them warm to balance the coldness.
