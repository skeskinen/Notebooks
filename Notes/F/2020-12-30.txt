====== Tradition is smarter than you ======

Most of the time you go against tradition you are wrong. Yet live players have to go against the traditions, take risks and create new avenues of success. 
If you understand the origin of a tradition you can analyze why it was put in place and if it can be removed, circumvented or replaced with a better system.

====== Nonduality ======

Enlightenment is not an end state of a journey, something that you work towards with a series of well defined steps.
Enlightenment is seeing the world as it really is. Just raw observations, neutral, unhindered by interpretation.

Your mind might be so clouded that you need to do a lot of work to reach enlightenment. But essentially everything you need is already in you.

Your feelings are the reality. The goal of meditation is to see the reality, see the wold as it really is.
You should avoid thinking about the experience since that adds interpretation+expectations and makes it harder to see the raw feelings, the reality.

Seeing that the world is neutral is good because negative thoughts and feelings are often self-perpetuating. Hate, anger, tiredness, etc. lead to more negative emotions and thoughts. Seeing everything in the world as they really are lets you escape those negative loops.
The neutrality lets you build the interpretation that you want. Seeing the world as neutral leaves you in control. You'll still have somethings that you prefer. But you are in control, you can work towards those preferable things.

What stays constant thought the life is the Observer, I. Thoughts and feelings come and go but the awareness is constant.
If you try to see what the sensing self is, or where does the feeling of awareness originate you'll get closer to 'I'.
I am the presence of awareness to which all experiences, thoughts and feelings arise.

To love something means merging that thing with your true self. If you love something you can accept it as it is in a very stoic sense. The most concrete example is your body. You should love your body, totally accept it, feel it, be in complete harmony. You'll be able to accept both the good and the bad things that happen to your body. The good and bad things are really just neutral, but you love them since you are one with them.
In this way the goal of stoicism is to love everything in the world. To merge everything with your sensing, aware self. Complete unconditional acceptance of the world.

Whoever knows himself, knows his Lord.

====== Issue with nondualism ======

Nondualism starts with consciousness as primary. It sees the materialistic view of the universe as a twisted interpretation of our imagination.
But you have to be able to accept (on some level) the model that best predicts the things you perceive. There is very strong evidence that matter exists, there is physical reality.
Nondualism has no predictive power.

Can you be nondualist and materialist at the same time? It's not immediately obvious why these positions have to be exclusive. Would that make you dualist? Dualist typically means something different.
Consciousness is primary but all evidence points to matter existing so you should also accept that.

====== Knowledge traditions ======

Knowledge traditions create definitions that can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Sciences, philosophies, religions, arts are all examples of knowledge traditions.

They usually also produce some practical results:
Science lets us measure and modify physical world
Religion has meditative practises, spiritual experiences and practical psychology
Arts can evoke feelings and communicate ideas that are too complex for language

====== Extremism ======

We call a knowledge tradition far-x when they stop being helpful to conversations and stop generating useful definitions.
Often this will lead to some useful change in a burst of creative destruction. But lately there is more fringes where extremist knowledge traditions can live.

====== Ready made answers ======

I don't need answers. I don't need to believe that one of the religions or philosophies has figured out the ultimate truth.
Maybe none of them has done it, it doesn't matter either way.

Agnostism is the tradition of doubt. Tradition of not knowing if we can know.

It's better to have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.

====== Social beings ======

Stoics often wrote about "gods or atoms". Even if god doesn't exists we are still social animals and should still live according to the stoic virtues.

====== Simplification ======

After a knowledge tradition has all the knowledge they can hope to gather, they can still work on the presentation. Make their ideas simpler and easier to teach.
They can still train new practitioners if their knowledge has practical applications. They don't need to go into extremism.

Interactivity is a good avenue for this simplification process. You can make your idea simpler and allow further exploration through interactivity.

====== Meta-identity and ego ======

Religions often function as a type of meta-identity. All your other identities are explained in terms of your religious identity that is all-encompassing.
After the fall of religions and the rise of individualistic existentialist thinking, people often build their super-identity and life-story around their ego. This leads to fragile personality and comparative mindset.
