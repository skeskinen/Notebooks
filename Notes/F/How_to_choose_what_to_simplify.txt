====== How to choose what to simplify ======
Created Sunday 11 October 2020

Choosing what to simplify is an artistic choice. The decision is always somewhat arbitrary.
Should you use existing library? Implement your own? What is truly the simplest solution. Both can be seen as simpler in their own way.

Simplification should:
* Enhance the collective IQ of your organization
* Make the system more resilient to (external) changes/pressure
