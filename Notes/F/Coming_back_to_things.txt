====== Coming back to things ======
Created Sunday 27 September 2020

In meditation you have to accept that you will have thoughts but the important part is to return to the thing you are meditating on.

I feel similar process should happen on a larger scale with all the distractions/addictions you have. E.g. youtube/games/movies.
When you practice getting your desires under control, you should notice and accept the lapses. No judgement, just notice and return to your commitment.

If the analogy with meditation makes sense it should get easier to return and the lapses should become shorter as you practice.
