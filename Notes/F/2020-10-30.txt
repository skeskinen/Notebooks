====== Tyrants ======

Tyrants lead unstable regimes because they'll have lots of enemies. 

How do you decide the leader then, if they're not the biggest and meanest one?
Maybe the leader should be the one with the best social skills who is likely to lead the most stable regime?
Maybe the leader should be the one who best understands what the group needs?


====== Virtue, self-sufficiency, just-world fallacy ======

How should one internalize needs, desires, happiness, justice in a world that is cold and chaotic and with other people who are cruel and unjust?
Isn't passivity like in daoism just a version of just-world fallacy? Just accepting the world as is can't be justice in an unjust world.

Stoicism and christianity became popular in times of uncertainty and adversity. In bad times humans gravitate towards philosophies ta provide solace.
"Perpetrator of injustice injures himself more than his the victim."
A stoic cannot be harmed since their sense of value is entirely internal.


For stoic virtue is the only good. You don't do good things for the sake of doing good. You do good things to be virtuous.

====== Stoicism and action ======

Stoicism is an active philosophy. They value courage to actually do things. Many stoics are politicians or otherwise active participants in the society.

====== Philosophy ======

Philosophy should tell people what they actually need.
