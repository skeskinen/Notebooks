====== Why do programmers think differently from writers ======
Created Monday 28 September 2020

I don't understand why the ways programmers work are so different from writers.

Writers collect notes, do research etc.
Consult the notes to check what the topic is and then start writing from abundance.
The process of writing is largely process of reduction and elimination.


This doesn't sound anything like what programmers are doing. Is programming so different from writing?
In my mind there is a clear analogy between organizing formalisms into a working program and organizing thoughts into a coherent argument/story.
Could the writers process be made into effective programming paradigm?
