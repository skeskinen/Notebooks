====== Stress ======

Almost anything in life can be done either in a way that increases or decreases stress.
Tai chi tries to be a combat sport that relaxes the body.
Speedrunning animal crossing or stardew valley. Obsessing over self-help or how to relax.

Usually the stressing activities involve some sort of comparative mindset. Feeling that you're not good enough or not doing enough.
In these cases, as per usual, you need to focus on the present. What you can do right now.
