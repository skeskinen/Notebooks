====== Removing requirements ======

Getting rid of existing requirements is one of the core problems in everything.
Cycles might help insofar as people are able to gain distance from the requirements and see them from a new light. Systems that break on purpose work in similar manner.


====== History ======

History is studying the circumstances that lead to your existence. It is important to understand your own context.

====== Systems and altruism ======

Stoics say that people should foremost be citizens of the cosmos. This would make the society consist of mostly altruistic parts.

Biological systems like bodies are built out of parts that are altruistic at the bottom level.

If you see in your life a situation that would make you behave selfishly, you should ask why is the system that way or how you could change the situation so that you don't need to do so.

Also anarchists mostly do some sort of altruism assumptions. At least on tribe level.

Altruism assumption makes bottom-up organization pretty tempting. Nature is also very bottom-up oriented.
