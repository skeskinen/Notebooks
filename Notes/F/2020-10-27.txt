====== Splitting ideologies into their relevant parts ======

If people were to get better with age at dissecting ideologies into good and bad bits, we wouldn't have so many smart right-wingers who believe that covid is a hoax.
They identify strongy with the 'man of liberty' that they have to reject the whole disease and even the sensible damage reduction methods.

====== Personal responsibility ======

Weak people turn to government and give away their freedom so that they don't have to take personal responsibility.

Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.
— Benjamin Franklin

The job of the government is not to solve people's problems. They should just facilitate problem solving and provide justice.

People need to unite under the banner of the individual. We need to be independent together.
Totalitarianism is the easy way out; the logical conclusion of externalizing responsibilities.
Weak and divided people are susceptible to totalitarianism. They will unite under a tyrant. Externalize all responsibility to that tyrant.

====== Amor Fati ======
"I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: Let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-Sayer.
— Friedrich Nietzsche


====== Tao Te Ching ======

Lao Tzu speaks in riddles. It seems paradoxal since that is not the natural way.

Solving these riddles gives me a small dopamine hit.
Gateway theory of understanding: the intellectual challenge makes the whole thing seem more valuable.

Lao Tzu also seems really elitist and nasty.

It seems there are some interesting parallels to postmodernism? Words have no meaning and so on. I think Chomsky's critique of postmodernism seems relevant to Tao Te Ching as well...

Ch41: "Lesser scholar hearing the TAO, has a good laugh. Without the laughter it wouldn't be TAO."
I definitely laughed at the absurdity of this book. The seeming hypocrisy and sarcasm, make it look a joke book. Remarks like this one in ch41 leave a very bad taste.
It honestly, unfortunately feels like sophistry.

But it's weird because I think I still agree with the key points of daoism as far as I understand them right now. Maybe it is a sign of the times that the youtube videos seem better than the classics.

Wisdom that is ununderstandable is not wisdom.
Philosophy that is unactionable is not philosophy.
