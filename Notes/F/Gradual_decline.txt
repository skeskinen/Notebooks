====== Gradual decline ======
Created Saturday 05 September 2020

The decline of civilizations appears gradual because the dysfunctional institutions are cannibalizing the functional ones. This process can be quite slow if the functional ones are sizable at the beginning of the process. Over time the dysfunctional parts of the society consume larger and larger percentage of the total productive capacity. There are at least a few necessary conditions for this process to continue:
1) The dysfunctional institutions have to viewed as necessary. I.e. "The banks are too big to fail".
2) Their faults cannot be so obvious that they are unhidable from the public. This is usually easy as all complex institutions are good at hiding their true colors.
3) The dysfunctional institutions have enough leverage over the people in power so that they keep feeding the institutions more and more.
4) They lack either the ability or will to correct their course. This is almost given from the definition of dysfunctional institution.

This process of cannibalization will manifest as inequality and loss of society's capabilites. As more and more functional institutions are destroyed, things that used to be possible become too expensive or just unobtainable.
