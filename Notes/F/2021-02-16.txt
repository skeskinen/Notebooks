====== Stability ======

Stability is required for economy to function. Nobody will invest into anything without stability. E.g. Botswana or California regulations.
This is linked to the economic concept of animal spirits.

====== Human drives, hierarchy of needs ======

Humans are driven by needs of: dignity, control and stability

====== Way forward ======

The only way there can be real improvements is one person at a time. There needs to be a critical mass of healthy, self-actualized people who feel that they are in control. They will form the functioning society.
They need to be self-actualized so that theiy don't overindulge in power.

The ultimate hidden truth of the world
is that it is something we make
and could just as easily make differently

====== Awe ======

Awe makes people realize that they are not that important. That they are just a part of something larger. That they are not in control, but the world can be more than they thought it was.
