====== ADD and vata ======

Vata mind tends to wander which makes it harder to absorb information. If they can concentrate they are flexible and make insightful associations.

To balance ADD you should reduce vata.

====== Vata and bowel movements ======

Target for bowel movements should be consistent (daily), smooth and fairly firm.
Vata probably needs a lot of dietary fiber to achieve this.
If it's too wet, add more fiber. Fiber probably just generally good for vata. I'm not sure what causes constipation.

====== Confidence, ego, competition and achievement ======

Competitions can lead to achievements that can build confidence. Confidence dimishes ego. Comparing yourself to others, like is directly done at competitions, builds ego.

====== Internet conversations ======

You can't really tell people what the world is like in short form. You need something like dialog or a lecture to convey complex ideas. If you try to write a comment too succinctly people will just get confused.
