====== Tech and Toxic Diversity ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

The point of diversity is to destroy bubbles.
It is meant to make decision-making better by reducing groupthink.

When diversity is the only accepted policy it becomes meaningless or counter productive.
It doesn't reduce groupthink but diversity becomes the new group

Big tech has some of the worst echo chambers in the world. And they are all about diversity.

HR becomes unable to solve the problem it was created to solve.
As HR becomes unable to do its job it grows in size.
