====== Inner-directed, alienation, layers of abstraction, consumerism ======

Self-actualization movement of 1960-1980s in the US was easily hijacked by corporate interests. Self-actualized people became excellent consumers of individualized products. There was no class consciousness, no political movement, no need for changing the system. You could be perfectly happy just by being true to yourself and consuming.

Most people living in cities are many levels removed from actually producing stuff. Even factory workers are alienated by their monotonous labor.
People who are inner-directed are so far removed from producing stuff that they don't see how that could be their calling.

I think that if production of goods and services was more straightforward, with less levels of abstraction and complexity, it would be much more inspiring for people.
People want to be good at things, learn to be good at something and do useful things for their communities. But in the current system of production most don't know where to even start.
Better eduction and marketing would also help. Apprenticeships, functional trade schools, production demonstrations, mock factories and farms, etc.

====== Focus groups, mass marketing, metrics ======

The goal of the marketers, people promoting individuality, was to maximize profits by selling as much stuff as possible.
They used psychoanalysis and focus groups to really figure out how to get people to consume more.

The techniques are powerful and effective but the goal was abhorrent. Something similar could be done to create a world where people care about the nature.
