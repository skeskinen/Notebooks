====== Results oriented ======
If you are focused on the result and fail, the time you spent becomes wasted. 

You should constantly focus on the present and cherish it.

If you fail you weren't ready. It wasn't meant to be. But you won't be afraid of trying again since your time cannot be wasted. You enjoy every moment.

If you catch yourself becoming result oriented, use it as a reminder. Notice that you are living in the future and not in the present. Be grateful for that reminder and make good use of it.

It is not the success that makes one noble but the effort to keep trying even after failure.
This thing we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down.
