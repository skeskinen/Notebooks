====== Truth, lies and personalities ======

You shouldn't lie because you'll have to negotiate things with yourself. If you habitually lie you can't trust yourself.

Speaking truth has real fitness, outside of manipulative function. For a well oriented person the morality of truth should come from within.

People create their own morals in a dialog between their personalities and society.

====== Circular reasoning ======

Circular logic or reasoning is not necessarily a bad thing. Remember strange loops etc.
There can be useful structure and associations in a circular argument.

====== Rational self and self-tyranny ======

Stoics want your rational self to have complete control over your body and emotions. This is potentially useful, but your rational self needs to be a good ruler or it's a tyranny.
Your rational self needs to realize that there are many parts to you and that each of them has different needs and desires. Many of these desires are impossible to fullfil or harmful so your rational self will need to negotiate with your other parts on how to resolve these things.

====== Constructive truth ======

There is some sort of truth in everything people say. They are true in the context they are said. If the person saying the things is emotionally hurt or anxious etc. the truth doesn't necessarily match with the reality.
But the truth of the utterance is constructed by the context that created the utterance.

Emotional mind
Ego
Intellectual mind

E.g. you are rejected by the girl you like and later rationalize to yourself that she wasn't that attractive in the first place. Both your initial attraction and the refutation are true, but they are constructed differently and in a different context.


Rational truth is a thought that is accurate predictor of the future based on sound model of the world.
A rational person deals in rational truths and thus can predict the world. They can control their emotions and ego by speaking truth to them and since the intellectual side is rational those promises are usually kept.
