====== Communicating values ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Steve Jobs: Marketing is about values.
You have limited communication bandwidth to your customers. And they don't really care. So you make them care by communicating your values.

What do you want to communicate and how do you choose that?
Values - stories - knowledge - wisdom

All communication is to some extent marketing.
