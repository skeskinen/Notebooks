====== Structure and representation ======
Created Tuesday 29 September 2020

Only structured knowledge can be represented cleanly and efficiently.

For unstructured knowledge the best you can do is a book.
Which is fine but books actually have a lot of structure, it's just not visible in the end product.

Unstructured knowledge becomes untagled mess that makes reading very hard.
