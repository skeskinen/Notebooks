Codifying thoughts. There must be some patterns of arguments that repeat. 
Codifying those patterns would be one way of transferring knowledge.
Codified thinking patterns can be repeated.


You need to know what you want to be thinking about. Once you know what you want to think about you can choose the right thinking pattern.
People who are skilled at using formalised patterns of thinking can choose the right one for the issue.
This is what people mean when they say they think with paper. They have more organized system for thinking.
It starts with knowing what you want to think about.
