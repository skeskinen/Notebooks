Growing up: meet the requirements placed onto you by the society.

Growing up: find wisdom.



Dr. K would say that your value of self should not come from how well you meet the external requirements.
True growing up means that you find what the society needs from you. You find what you can offer to the society. Know thyself.

That pretty much sums up what I want to say with the whole thing about requirements evolving with the code, finding the essense of the code or the natural way of the code.

Claiming that you can do all that is asked of you is just being a yes man. It leads to all sorts of mental issues.

The programmers of ye olde times were closer to "knowing themselves". They had somehow developed a better understanding of what the society actually needs from them. This is partly why they were able to develop amazing products in a natural way.


It is important that the exploration of the natural code doesn't turn into navalgazing. There needs to be a concrete use case for the code. Research is not good enough since it is too abstract. Hero's journey and returning something to your community.
