====== Direction of innovations ======
Created Sunday 11 October 2020

Innovations in a society usually happen in the field that drives expansion. Whatever is seen as the limiting factor of progress is what most people will focus on.

The innovation has to be timed so that it will actually produce results. The results are necessary so that the pioneers will acquire wealth and power to drive the innovation forward. This means that there is some sort of natural order for innovations. There are economic, social and technological prerequisites for each innovation.

With startups you can get so much funding that the "gaining wealth through improvements" side isn't as important.
