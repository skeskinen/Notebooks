====== Known good states and simplicity ======
Created torstai 01 lokakuu 2020

Game consoles behave the same way every time you start them.

They can still be very customizable since you can change cartridges. The cartridges can even store save games.

But the machine is always returned to known good state when you reset. 

This is rather elegant. Why can't we make a smartphone or pc that has a known good state?

Of course things like note taking would be harder. Web of notes is a very stateful thing.
