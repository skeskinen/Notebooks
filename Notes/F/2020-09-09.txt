====== Democratizing education ======

Existing educational institutions are slow to adapt and expensive. There is a lot of vested interest in not changing the school systems.

Computers could be used to deliver decentralized education. For the most part this hasn't happened. 

Universities are under most pressure, from youtube lectures to cheap online courses like coursera.

Computer education for younger students hasn't really taken off.

One laptop per child and similar programs have tried to implement computer education concepts in poor countries. These programs have been mostly failures. The biggest problems with OLPC were various issues with the hardware, politics and funding and lack of focus on education or research. There is a lack of studies that show OLPC helping to educate children.
OLPC was unable to fulfill the constructivist dream.
Units of hardware shipped is an easy metric to track, amount of education provided requires that you track the units but it is doable. The amount of learning that happened is very hard to put into a metric.
There was a good deal of hardware, some education but very little learning.
