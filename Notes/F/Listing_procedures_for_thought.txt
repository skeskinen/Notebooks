====== Listing procedures for thought ======
Created keskiviikko 07 lokakuu 2020

Imagine there was a list of steps for all higher-order cognitive procedures. This list could be used as a teaching tool provided that you can describe them in enough detail and why some of them are better in some situations than others.

Would the art of programming have something to give to such a list? Programmers should be able to improve these procedures somehow.
