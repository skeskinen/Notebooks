====== Play, education and nand2tetris ======

Play is characterized by exploration and freedom in the results. Educational projects should not be too well defined or they risk becoming boring.

Nand2tetris felt pretty fun for the most part. The chapters are well defined for the most part which makes it kind of counter example. But at least the way I did the programming parts there was a lot of freedom and reverse engineering which is type of exploration. 

The enjoyable part of software projects should be the exploration of the unknown. But it is often also scary and lifeless.
