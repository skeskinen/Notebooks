====== Organization survival ======
Created Tuesday 15 September 2020

Once org becomes about propagating itself, it becomes inflexible. Growing parts of the org are directed towards resisting changes.

Ultimately the resistance to change will be the orgs downfall as it's unable to adapt to changes in the environment. It's collective IQ is low as it can't change it's behaviour based on external stimulus.

This is similar to the process of aging in individuals.

Powerful orgs will also try to fight to keep the environment constant, but this will always fail in the end.
