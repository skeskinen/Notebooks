====== Global world ======

Global interconnectness increases the likelyhood that local events have global consequences.
This makes the world more chaotic as a whole.

On the other hand, the global order has kept things in balance.

We'll need local thinkers, local justice, local leaders. Local resposibility and global co-operation and coordination.

====== Roles and specialization ======

In a changing world, it's generally better to be generalist since your specialized skills are likely to go to waste.

We need social fabric to support the people who weren't as lucky with their role. We need actually believe that the life is not a competition.

There will be enough complex tasks that people need to specialize.

There will be cycles in relevances of the different classes. There needs to be narrative that keeps people interested in the roles that are less relevant in the moment.

====== Previous generation ======

It is the responsibility of the previous generation to come up with the roles and structure for the next generation.

====== Roles and gender disphoria, Dr. K & Contrapoints ======

In a world with better defined roles and guiderails there will be more role disphoria. It could be useful to analyze the kind of problems that trans people have and what leads them to transition.
Contrapoints said that she had formed a model of what men and women are based on rolemodels and just couldn't see herself as a man.
"In medschool, don't think of what kind of doctor you want to become but try to find a rolemodels."

What if you are not like your rolemodels and can't ever be? People develop obsessions over becoming something they aren't.
Wanting to change to make yourself better is good. Wanting to change to please others or fit socially is problematic.
