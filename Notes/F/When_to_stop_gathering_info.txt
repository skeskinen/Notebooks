====== When to stop gathering info ======
Created Tuesday 15 September 2020

On every problem there is some information tipping point where additional information becomes useless/harmfull.

Recognizing and accepting these tipping points requires a leap of faith; you can't be certain about the future. The org must be ready to accept the ambiguity.

Agile organizations should be good at spotting these tipping points and cutting off the information gathering process.
