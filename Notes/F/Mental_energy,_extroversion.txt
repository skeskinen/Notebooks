====== Mental energy, extroversion ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

Introverts spent more energy per social interaction.
Aleksi spoke about the weight you give for each social interaction and how spending time hiking changes that. When hiking you learn to care about every person you meet. That strategy fails when you come back to city life because in cities you will be exhausted if you care about random people you pass by on the streets.

Hypothesis: Extroverts can effectively block more social context from their thought process.
Test setup: Do extrovents notice less beggars when walking on the streets than introverts.


Would this mean introverted people are more empathetic?
You could look into correlation between extroversion and empathy. But I think empathy is not well defined in psychology.
