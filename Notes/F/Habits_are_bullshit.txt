====== Habits are bullshit ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

Failing to stick to a habit is not a character flaw but a personality trait. Some people just find habits boring. Trying to stick to a boring habit doesn't end well. Eventually you'll get fed up and drop the activity completely. Repeating the same actions over and over doesn't suit everyone. Some people need more stimulus than that.

Being a person who can't keep a habit doesn't give you an excuse not to practise your skills.  You just need to find a way to think about your practise in a way that gives you the variety you need. For example if you want to practise fiction writing don't just allocate a big blob in your calendar for writing practice but divide it into more interesting and different pieces. You can do character profiles on Monday, work on your big project on Tuesday, write dialogue on Wednesday and so on.

It is also ok to take breaks. After all you don't want to burn out on your habits. The important part is to acknowledge that you need a break and make sure that you eventually resume the activity. Keep a list of all your ongoing projects to give yourself accountability.
