Is the position of a bush in a Mario level knowledge?

In the game code it occupies bits. And it was hand picked by an artist.
But nobody would know/care if it moved a bit.

Games tend to have a lot of this kind of "B-knowledge". Trivia.
Most art does.
Good artists minimize irrelevant parts.
Games need to have worlds that are not 100% art. A lot of stuff just has to be consistent with the world to build immersion and continuity.

Should gamedev tools separate important bits from trivia?
Should coding tools separate important bits from trivia?
